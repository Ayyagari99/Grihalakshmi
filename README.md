# Grihalakshmi

‘Grihalakshmi’ literally translates to ‘Goddess of the house’. Our aim is to encourage women to be independent and earn their livelihood. We aim to promote women’s community participation and connect those with common skills, by developing a platform to encourage women to interact, learn and develop their skills.
